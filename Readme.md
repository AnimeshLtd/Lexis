# Lexis

A Ruby script that reads text supplied in a separate file, analyse it for various patterns and
statistics, and prints out the results for the user. 

I've chosen Ruby for this project because its regular expression features make it a no-brainer 
for text and document analysis. Next steps, publishing this as a Ruby on Rails project with a 
fancy UI.
